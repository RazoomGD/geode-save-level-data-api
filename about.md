# Save Level Data API

<cr>(!)</c> This is an **API** mod. Which means that it's only needed as a dependency for other mods. If you aren't a mod developer don't pay attention to it :)


<cg>If you are a mod developer:</c>

- This mod provides simple methods to store any <cy>level-specific values</c> retaining them when copying the level.
- Optionally you can save these values in a special text object <cj>right inside the level</c> so that the values could be retained even after sharing/publishing the level
