# Save Level Data API

This is an **API** mod. Which means that it's only needed as a dependency for other mods. If you aren't a mod developer don't pay attention to it :)


<cg>If you are a mod developer:</c>

- With this mod you can easily store and handle all <cg>level-specific data</c> of your mod.
- You can save your values to the local save file of your mod
- Or you can save them to the special text object right inside the level (to preserve values when sharing/publishing the level)
